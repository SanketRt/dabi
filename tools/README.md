## 🧠 Algorithm Details

### DQN Architecture

The agent uses a **Dueling DQN** architecture with the following components:

- **🔍 Feature Extraction**: Dense layers with batch normalization and dropout
- **💎 Value Stream**: Estimates state value V(s)
- **⚖️ Advantage Stream**: Estimates action advantages A(s,a)
- **🔗 Q-Value Combination**: Q(s,a) = V(s) + A(s,a) - mean(A(s,a))

### Training Features

- **🎯 Prioritized Experience Replay**: Samples important experiences more frequently
- **🎯 Target Network**: Stabilizes training with periodic updates
- **🎲 Epsilon-Greedy Exploration**: Balances exploration and exploitation
- **✂️ Gradient Clipping**: Prevents exploding gradients
- **📊 Reward Clipping**: Bounded rewards for stable learning

### Reward Structure

The environment provides shaped rewards to guide learning:

| Action | Reward | Cap | Description |
|--------|--------|-----|-------------|
| 📦 **Box Completion** | +0.5 per box | +2.0 | Encourages box capturing |
| ⚠️ **Creating 3-Edge Box** | -0.1 penalty | -0.5 | Discourages gift setups |
| 👣 **Regular Move** | -0.01 | - | Encourages efficiency |
| 🏆 **Win/Loss** | ±1.0 | - | Final outcome bonus |
| 📈 **Score Margin** | ±0.5 × tanh(diff) | - | Proportional victory bonus |
| ❌ **Invalid Move** | -1.0 | - | Prevents illegal actions |

## 🔧 Configuration

The project uses YAML configuration files for easy parameter tuning:

```yaml
# configs/training.yaml
training:
  episodes: 3000

  learning_rate: 5e-4
  gamma: 0.95
  epsilon_start: 1.0
  epsilon_end: 0.01
  epsilon_decay: 0.995

- **📋 Tensorboard Support**: Detailed training logs
- **💾 Automatic Checkpointing**: Best model saving
- **📈 Performance Plots**: Generated training visualizations

## 🎮 Game Rules

**Dots and Boxes** is a classic paper-and-pencil game:

1. 🎯 Players take turns drawing lines between adjacent dots
2. 📦 When a player completes a box (4 edges), they score a point and take another turn
3. 🏁 The game ends when all possible lines are drawn
4. 🏆 The player with the most boxes wins

### 🧠 Strategic Elements

- **⛓️ Chain Rule**: Completing boxes often creates opportunities for more boxes
- **🎁 Sacrifice Strategy**: Sometimes giving away boxes to maintain control
- **🏁 Endgame Planning**: Managing the final box completions

## 📚 Research Background

This implementation is based on several key papers:

- **🤖 DQN**: Mnih et al. (2015) - Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning
- **⚔️ Dueling DQN**: Wang et al. (2016) - Dueling Network Architectures for Deep Reinforcement Learning
